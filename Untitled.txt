Division of Work

Megan - Front-end Design for Main Menu, Admin Login (Help with front end for Library and make a card (Hard code User/Admin Login)

Justin - Animating cards/Database for library 

Zach - Back end For library, and for Create a card. Attempt for the image manipulation (Talking to White 10/28)


General Ideas

	Main Menu - Pictures with blur effect moving from right to left in the background (Justin)

	Library - Slider Bar (Or +/- image size adjust) And possibly the Cover Flow View from low - fidelity Prototype With animations by Justin
	
	Create a Card - Honestly have no idea how to do photo until talking to White tomorrow. 
			(An idea is we could have the user outline themselves with their mouse to delete the excess photo)

	Admin Login - hard code a user login and admin login. Possible admin features such as delete a card?
